            <ul>
                <li><b>Setup</b> - Depending on the 3PL, this one-time fee will include software integration, warehouse tours, and training. </li>
                <li><b>Receiving</b> — Most 3PLs charge per shipment received to their warehouse. It may be an hourly rate for unloading, performing cycle counts, and entering products into inventory management system. It could also be a flat fee per delivery, or a flat rate per SKU. </li>
                <li><b>Storage</b> — Most 3PLs charge a storage fee per square feet or necessary space in their fulfillment center. Some charge on a per pallet basis.</li>
                <li><b>Fulfillment</b> — This covers picking, packaging, labels, package inserts, package customization (if desired), and order processing. Costs vary depending on how many of the above steps are necessary for your products.</li>
                <li><b>Shipping</b> — In most cases, you will receive a significant discount over shipping carrier listed rates because 3PLs receive bulk shipping rates based on their scale and order volume, as well as discounts negotiated with specific carriers. </li>
            </ul><br><br>
